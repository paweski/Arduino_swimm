# Arduino_swimm

Outdoor swimming pools often have separate chamber for pipes, pumps and controling devices. The chamber is dug in the ground beside pool. 
During winter time low temperatures freezes the chamber so there is a need to keep temperature above freezing point. 
This is done by measuring temperature in the chamber and heating the chamber by switching on/off two halogen bulbs as heaters. 
Arduino Uno + DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor + 2 relays were used for that purpose.
